  <p> Cricket is a unifying force around the world and ignites a passion in many. It is also a popular career choice for cricket enthusiasts as it gives them an opportunity
      to indulge their love for the game Criconet has launched e-Coaching (patent applied for)
       for cricketers who want to learn cricket from square one, and for players who want to improve their game with help from a professional coach.
        Our core belief is that everyone should be given an opportunity to be the best at what they want to be.
        We want to make sure everyone who loves cricket has an opportunity to excel at it by making cricket coaching more accessible.
        We see no reason why a well-deserving cricketer canâ€™t go from being an amateur to a professional and make their dreams come true.
        Criconet's e-Coaching suits all budgets as well, and our platform focuses on providing an easy access to coaching for potential cricketers everywhere!
